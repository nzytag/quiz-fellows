# Quiz Fellows
### 201 Final Project
---

This app was designed for 201 students to use as a study guide based on the topics covered in class and lab.


Our goal was to create the app using as many tools as possible learned in the past four weeks at Code Fellows. We hope this app will serve future 201 students as a resource and continue to grow with time.
